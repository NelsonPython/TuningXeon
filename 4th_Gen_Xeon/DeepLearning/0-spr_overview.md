# Introducing Intel® AVX-512 and Intel® Deep Learning Boost

#########################################

REVIEWER NOTE : increased the heading -it was difficult to see when we were moving between major sections with ##

##########################################
Intel&reg; Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512) is a &ldquo;single instruction, multiple data&rdquo; (SIMD) instruction set based on x86 processors that allows executing multiple data operations with a single instruction. As the name implies, Intel&reg; AVX-512 has a register width of 512 bits, and it supports 16 32-bit single-precision floating-point numbers or 64 8-bit integers.

Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable Processors support multiple types of workloads, including complex AI workloads.  They improve AI computation performance with the use of Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost (Intel&reg; DL Boost). Intel Deep Learning Boost includes Intel&reg; AVX-512 VNNI (Vector Neural Network Instructions), AVX512 BF16 and AMX (Advanced Matrix Extension).

AVX-512 VNNI can combine three instructions (vpmaddubsw, vpmaddwd, and vpaddd) into one (vpdpbusd) execution.  This further unleashes the computing potential of next-generation Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable Processors and increases the inference performance of the INT8 model. 2nd Generation, 3rd Generation, and 4th Generation Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable Processors all support VNNI.

The AVX-512_BF16 feature includes an instruction (VDPBF16PS) to compute dot product of BF16 pairs and to accumulate to single precision (FP32), as well as instructions (VCVTNE2PS2BF16, VCVTNEPS2BF16) to convert packed single precision data (FP32) to packed BF16 data.

Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel® AMX) is a new 64-bit programming paradigm consisting of two components: a set of 2-dimensional registers (tiles) representing sub-arrays from a larger 2-dimensional memory image and an accelerator able to operate on tiles.  The first implementation is called TMUL (tile matrix multiply unit).

### Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost

| Processor | AVX-512 VNNI | AVX-512 BF16 | AMX|
|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Cascade Lake     | V           |             |             | 
| Cooper Lake      | V           |V            |             | 
| Ice Lake         | V           |             |             | 
| Sapphire Rapids  | V           |V            | V           | 

#### AVX-512 VNNI

![Deep Learning VNNI](images/dl-vnni.jpg)

Platforms not using VNNI require the&nbsp;<strong>vpmaddubsw, vpmaddwd&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;vpaddd</strong>&nbsp;instructions to complete the multiply-accumulate operations in INT8 convolution operation:

![Diagram showing INT8 described in text](images/dl-int8-1.jpg)

Platforms using VNNI require only one instruction, &ldquo;vpdpbusd&rdquo;, to complete the INT8 convolution operation:

![Diagram showing INT8 described in text](images/dl-int8-2.jpg)

#### AMX

AMX introduces a new matrix register file with eight rank-2 tensor registers called “tiles”.  It also introduces the concept of accelerators that are capable of operating on those tiles. The matrix register file comprises eight tiles (named TMM0…TMM7), each having a maximum size of 16 rows by 64-byte columns for a total size of 1 KiB/register and 8 KiB for the entire register file.  Load a tile representing a small section from a larger image in memory, operate on that tile, and repeat with the next tile that represents the next portion of the image.  When done, store the resultant tile to memory.  The Tile Matrix Multiply (TMUL) unit comprises a grid of fused multiply-add units capable of operating on tiles.

##### AMX sub-extensions and related instructions

The AMX extension comprises three sub-extensions: AMX-TILE, AMX-INT8, and AMX-BF16.
| Instruction | AMX-TILE | AMX-INT8 | AMX-BF16|

| &emsp; Power Performance Tuning | OS Controls EPB |

### Memory

Use all available memory channels

### CPU

The 4th Generation of Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable processor comes with the all new Intel&reg; AMX (Advanced Matrix Extensions) instruction set. Intel&reg; AMX provides acceleration for mixed precision deep learning training and inference workloads. The 4th Generation of Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable processor provides two instruction sets viz. AMX_BF16 and AMX_INT8 which provides acceleration for bfloat16 and int8 operations respectively

Note:  To confirm that AMX_BF16 and AMX_INT8 are supported by the CPU, enter the following command on the bash terminal and look for AMX in the "flags" section. In case AMX instructions are not getting listed, consider updating the Linux kernel to 5.17 and above

```
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo
```

### Network

If cross-node training clusters are required, choose high-speed networks, such as 25G/100G, for better scalability.

### Hard drive

For high I/O efficiency, use SSDs and drives with higher read and write speeds.

## Linux Operating System Optimization

To speed up processing tune the Linux operating system for parallel programming.

### OpenMP Parameter Settings

The [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) is a specification for parallel programming.  In case your application implements OpenMP based threading, experiment with the following environment variables and find the best fit values:

- OMP_NUM_THREADS = &ldquo;number of cpu cores in container&rdquo;
- KMP_BLOCKTIME = 1 or 0 (set according to actual type of model)
- KMP_AFFINITY=granularity=fine, verbose, compact,1,0

### Number of CPU cores

Consider the impact on inference performance based on the number of CPU cores being used, as follows:

&bull; When batchsize is small (in online services for instance) the increase in inference throughput gradually weakens as the number of CPU cores increases.  In practice, 8-16 CPU cores is recommended for service deployment depending on the model used.

&bull; When batchsize is large (in offline services for instance) the inference throughput can increase linearly as the number of CPU cores increases.  In practice, more than 20 CPU cores is recommended for service deployment.

``` # taskset -C xxx-xxx –p pid (limits the number of CPU cores used in service) ```

### NUMA Configuration

For NUMA-based servers, there is usually a 5-10% increase in performance when configuring NUMA on the same node compared to using it on different nodes.

``` #numactl -N NUMA_NODE -l command args ... (controls NUMA nodes running in service) ```

### Configuration of Linux Performance Governor

Efficiency is the key consideration.  Set the CPU frequency to its peak for the best performance.

``` # cpupower frequency-set -g performance ```

### CPU C-States Settings

There are several power modes available for each CPU which are collectively referred to as C-states or C-modes.  To reduce power consumption when the CPU is idle, the CPU can be placed in the low-power mode.  Disabling C-States can increase performance.

``` #cpupower idle-set -d 2,3 ```

# Using Intel® Extension for TensorFlow* for optimization and Performance boost

Intel® Extension for TensorFlow* adds optimizations for extra performance when running TensorFlow on Intel hardware. The intention of the extension is to deliver up-to-date features and optimizations for TensorFlow on Intel hardware. Examples include AVX-512 Vector Neural Network Instructions (AVX512 VNNI) and Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel® AMX).

Intel® Extension for TensorFlow* has been released as an open–source project at https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-tensorflow

## Install TensorFlow* and Intel® Extension for TensorFlow*

Refer to [Installation Guide](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-tensorflow/latest/docs/install/experimental/install_for_cpu.html) to install TensorFlow* and Intel® Extension for TensorFlow* for CPU.   
After having installed Intel® Extension for TensorFlow*, it will be activated automatically as a plugin of stock TensorFlow.

## Optimization Recommendations for Training and Inferencing TensorFlow-based Deep Learning Models

#########################################

REVIEWER NOTE : Could you provide a not explaining that oneDNN is now on by default with Tensor flow versions?

The ONEDNN_VERBOSE flag is discussed, and user may not be sure if they still need it 

##########################################


Intel® Extension for TensorFlow* is a Python package to extend official TensorFlow, achieve higher performance. Although stock TensorFlow and the default configuration of Intel® Extension for TensorFlow* perform well, there are still something that users can do for performance optimization on specific platforms. Most optimized configurations can be automatically set by the launch script. Mainly for the following:

- NUMA Control: numactl specifies NUMA scheduling and memory placement policy
- Number of instances: [Single instance (default) | Multiple instances]
- Memory allocator: [TCMalloc | JeMalloc | default Malloc] If unspecified, launch script will choose for user.  
- Runtime environment settings: OMP_NUM_THREADS, KMP_AFFINITY, KMP_BLOCKTIME, TF_NUM_INTEROP_THREADS, TF_NUM_INTRAOP_THREADS, ITEX_AUTO_MIXED_PRECISION, ITEX_LAYOUT_OPT, etc.

Refer to [Launch Script Usage Guide](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-tensorflow/latest/docs/guide/launch.html) for more details.

Refer to [Practice Guide](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-tensorflow/latest/docs/guide/practice_guide.html) for better understanding of common optimization tips which are used in launch script. 

## Enabling BFLOAT16
Intel® 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors support accelerating AI inference by using low precision data types such as BFloat16 and INT8 based on the Intel® Deep Learning Boost and Intel® Advanced Matrix Extension(AMX). There are several instructions such as AMX_BF16, AMX_INT8, AVX512_BF16, AVX512_VNNI to accelerate AI models.

Mixed Precision uses lower-precision data types (such as FP16 or BF16) to make models run faster and with less memory consumption during training and inference.

Stock Tensorflow provides two ways to do this, Grappler Graph Optimization [Auto Mixed Precision](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/graph_optimization)(AMP) and [Keras mixed precision API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/mixed_precision).

Intel® Extension for TensorFlow* is fully compatible with both of above methods in Stock TensorFlow, and provides an Advanced Auto Mixed Precision feature which is enhanced from Auto Mixed Precision of Stock TensorFlow for better performance.

**Intel® Extension for TensorFlow\* will turn off Auto Mixed Precision of Stock TensorFlow if its own Advanced Auto Mixed Precision is enabled explicitly.**

Refer to [Advanced Auto Mixed Precision](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-tensorflow/latest/docs/guide/advanced_auto_mixed_precision.html) for more details.

#### Enable Advanced AMP

There are 2 ways to enable Advanced AMP in Intel® Extension for TensorFlow*: Python API and Environment Variables, choose either one which works for you.

|Python API|Environment Variables|
|-|-|
|`import intel_extension_for_tensorflow as itex`<br><br>`auto_mixed_precision_options = itex.AutoMixedPrecosionOptions()`<br>`auto_mixed_precision_options.data_type = itex.BFLOAT16`<br><br>`graph_options = itex.GraphOptions(auto_mixed_precision_options=auto_mixed_precision_options)`<br>`graph_options.auto_mixed_precision = itex.ON`<br><br>`config = itex.ConfigProto(graph_options=graph_options)`<br>`itex.set_backend("cpu", config)`|`export ITEX_AUTO_MIXED_PRECISION=1`<br>`export ITEX_AUTO_MIXED_PRECISION_DATA_TYPE="BFLOAT16"`<br>|

### For Inference

# Using Intel® Extension for Pytorch* for optimization and Performance boost

Intel® Extension for PyTorch* adds optimizations for extra performance when running PyTorch on Intel hardware.  Most of the optimizations will be included in stock PyTorch releases eventually.  The intention of the extension is to deliver up-to-date features and optimizations for PyTorch on Intel hardware.  Examples include AVX-512 Vector Neural Network Instructions (AVX512 VNNI) and Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel® AMX).

Intel® Extension for PyTorch* has been released as an open–source project at [https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch)

```

### Optimization Recommendations for Training and Inferencing PyTorch-based Deep Learning Models

Although default primitives of PyTorch and Intel® Extension for PyTorch* are highly optimized, there are additional configuration options that can improve performance. Most can be applied by a launch script that automates setting configuration options, mainly for the following:

1. OpenMP library: [Intel OpenMP library (default) | GNU OpenMP library]
2. Memory allocator: [PyTorch default memory allocator | Jemalloc | TCMalloc (default)]
3. Number of instances: [Single instance (default) | Multiple instances]

For more details refer to [Launch Script Usage Guide](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/latest/tutorials/performance_tuning/launch_script.html)

Apart from launch scripts there are other hardware settings that include configuring the structure of Intel CPUs, as well as Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA).  Software configuration can be set to take advantage of Channels Last memory format, OpenMP, numactl to fully utilize CPU computation resources with Intel® Extension for PyTorch* to boost performance.  For more details refer to [Performance Tuning Guide](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/latest/tutorials/performance_tuning.html)

### Enabling BFLOAT16 Inference 

Intel® 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors support accelerating AI inference by using low precision data types such as BFloat16 and INT8 based on the Intel® Deep Learning Boost and Intel® Advanced Matrix Extension(AMX). There are several instructions such as AMX_BF16, AMX_INT8, AVX512_BF16, AVX512_VNNI to accelerate AI models.

#### Auto Mixed Precision(AMP)

` torch.cpu.amp ` provides convenience for auto data type conversion at runtime. Deep learning workloads can benefit from lower-precision floating point data types such as torch.float16 or torch.bfloat16, because of its lighter calculation workload and smaller memory usage. The Auto Mixed Precision (AMP) feature automates the tuning of data type conversions over all operators.

#### Steps to enable AMX_BF16

To check whether given cpu machine supports AMX_BF16 instructions, use ` lscpu ` command.

` torch.cpu.amp.autocast ` allows scopes of your script to run with mixed precision. In these scopes, operations run in a data type chosen by the autocast class to improve performance while maintaining accuracy.  The following simple network should show a speedup with mixed precision:

```
class SimpleNet(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(64, 128, (3, 3), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.conv(x)
        
```

` torch.cpu.amp.autocast ` is designed to be a context manager that allow the scope of your script to run with mixed precision. AMX_BF16 are newer and have more advanced intrinsics than AVX512_BF16. They offer better performance to support AI applications. Therefore, for the data type BFloat16, AMX_BF16 has the highest execution priority. The AI frameworks optimized by Intel will choose AMX_BF16 first. If it is not available, then AVX512_BF16 will be chosen.
For more details refer to [Auto Mixed Precision (AMP)](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/latest/tutorials/features/amp.html?highlight=amp)

```

model = SimpleNet().eval()
x = torch.rand(64, 64, 224, 224)
with torch.cpu.amp.autocast():
    y = model(x)
    
```
To Check whether AMX_BF16 is enabled, check for ` avx512_core_amx_bf16 ` JIT Kernel usage. Review the setting ` ONEDNN_VERBOSE=1 `

# Using Intel® Neural Compressor for Low Precision Optimization

## AI Neural Network Model Low Precision Optimization

### Overview

Intel® 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors support accelerating AI inference by using low precision data types such as BFloat16 and INT8 based on the Intel® Deep Learning Boost and Intel® Advanced Matrix Extension.

1. Quantization

Using the INT8 data type to optimize AI model is one type of quantization, the process of mapping continuous infinite values to a smaller set of discrete finite values.

2. Mixed Precision

Mixed Precision uses lower-precision data types such as BFloat16 to make models that run with 16-bit and 32-bit mixed floating-point types during training and inference.  This runs faster with less memory consumption.

### Instruction

Intel® 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors support several instructions to accelerate AI models:

|Intrinsics|AVX512_VNNI|AVX512_BF16|AMX_INT8|AMX_BF16|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Data type|INT8|BFloat16|INT8|BFloat16|
|Variable type|Vector|Vector|Matrix|Matrix|

AMX_INT8/AMX_BF16 are newer and more advanced intrinsics than AVX512_VNNI/AVX512_BF16.  They offer better performance to support AI applications.  AMX_INT8 has the highest execution priority.  The AI frameworks optimized by Intel will choose AMX_INT8 first.  If it is not available, then AVX512_VNNI will be chosen.

### Steps

1. Convert FP32 model to INT8/BFloat16 model.

   Run quantization or the mixed precision process to get the INT8/BFloat16 model.

2. Execute the INT8/BFloat16 model inference on Intel® 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors by the AI frameworks optimized for Intel Architecture.

   The AI framework will call highest level instrinsics supported by them in CPU to gain better performance.

   For example: If AI framework calls AVX512_VNNI, instead of AMX_INT8, please check if the newer release supports AMX_INT8 and install right release.

### AI Neural Network Quantization Process

Computations in neural networks are mainly concentrated in the convolution layer and the fully connected layer. The computations on these two layers can be expressed as:  Y = X * Weights + Bias. Therefore, it is natural to focus on matrix multiplication to optimize performance. The way to begin neural network model quantization is by trading-off precision (limited) for performance improvement. By replacing 32-bit floating-point numbers with low-precision integers for matrix operations, it not only speeds up calculations, but also compresses the model, thus saving memory bandwidth.

There are three approaches to the quantization of neural network models:

- Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), which is supported by most AI frameworks. Quantize a trained FP32 model. It execute a calibration process (infer FP32 model with small dataset) and record the data range of every layer's input and output. Then quantize the model according to the data range info. It provides good quantizatin result.

- Quantization-Aware-Training (QAT), which inserts the FakeQuantization node into the FP32 model when the training converges. It increases the quantization-induced noise. During the backpropagation stage of the training, the model weights fall into a finite interval which results in better quantization precision.

- Dynamic Quantization (DQ) is very similar to PTQ. They are both quantization methods used on post-trained models. The difference lies in that the quantization factor in the activation layer is dynamically decided by the data range used when the neural network model is run, while for PTQ samples from a small-scale pre-processed dataset are used to obtain data distribution and range information in the activation layer, then records it permanently in the newly generated quantization model. Of the Intel® Intel® Neural Compressor which we will talk about later on,  onnxruntime supports this method at the backend only.

The basic procedure for the post-training quantization of neural network is as follows:

1. Fuse FP32 OP to INT8 OP. For example, <em>MatMul</em>, <em>BiasAdd</em> and <em>ReLU</em> can be fused into a single quantized OP at the fully connected layer,  <em>QuantizedMatMulWithBiasAndRelu</em>. Different neural network frameworks support different fuse-able OPs.
For Intel® Intel® Neural Compressor, which will be discussed later on, here is a list of fuse-able OPs supported by TensorFlow: [https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/neural_compressor/adaptor/tensorflow.yaml#L110](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/neural_compressor/adaptor/tensorflow.yaml#L110).
For fuse-able OPs supported by pyTorch, please see : [https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/neural_compressor/adaptor/pytorch_cpu.yaml#L251](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/neural_compressor/adaptor/pytorch_cpu.yaml#L251)

2. Quantize weights and save them in the quantized model.

3. Quantize the input/activation layer by sampling the calibration dataset to acquire the distribution and range information of the data in the activation layer, which is then recorded in the newly generated quantized model.

4. The Requantize operation is fused into its corresponding INT8 OP to generate the final quantized model.

Using a simple model which includes two layers of  MatMul as an example, we can observe the quantization process as follows:

<div  align="center">
  <img src="images/dl-matmul.jpg" width = "70%" height = "70%" alt="MatMul" align=center />
</div>

### AI Neural Network Mixed Precision Process

FP32 and BFloat16 have same data range and different decimal part. It's easy to convert FP32 to BFloat16. But use BFloat16 will impact the model accuracy due to the cutted decimal part.

Some operations are numerically-safe for Bfloat16, that means the operation based on Bfloat16 has no obviously accuracy loss compared to FP32;

Some operations are numerically-dangerous for Bfloat16, that means the operation based on Bfloat16 has obviously accuracy loss compared to FP32;

The precedure is as follows:

1. According to the experiment, set the numerically-safe operations to allow set and numerically-dangerous operations to deny set.

   It's allow user to tune it manually by configuration.

2. Convert the operations in allow set to BFloat16.

3. Insert the "Cast" operation between FP32 and BFloat16 operations to convert data from FP32 to BFloat16 or revert.

Above precedure will be handled by AI framework/tool automaticlly.

### Intel® Neural Compressor

[Intel® Neural Compressor](https://intel.github.io/neural-compressor) is one of the key AI software components in the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit.  It is an open-source Python library that runs on Intel CPUs and GPUs.  This toolkit delivers unified interfaces across multiple deep learning frameworks for popular network compression technologies, such as quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. It supports automatic, accuracy-driven, tuning strategies to quickly find the best model.

### Using Intel® Neural Compressor

We are using  ResNet50 v1.0 as an example to explain how to use this tool for quantization and mixed precision optimization.

### Dataset preparation:

Step 1: Download and decompress the ImageNet validation dataset:

To download the raw images, the user must create an account with image-net.org.

```
mkdir –p img_raw/val
cd img_raw
wget http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/xxxxxxxx/ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar
tar –xvf ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar -C val
```

Step 2: Move the image files to the child directories sorted by label:


```
cd val
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soumith/imagenetloader.torch/master/valprep.sh | bash
```

Step 3: Use the script, [prepare_dataset.sh](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/examples/tensorflow/image_recognition/tensorflow_models/quantization/ptq/prepare_dataset.sh), to convert raw data to the TFrecord format with 128 shards:


```
git clone https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor.git
cd neural-compressor/
git checkout 6663f7b
cd examples/tensorflow/image_recognition/tensorflow_models/quantization/ptq
bash prepare_dataset.sh --output_dir=./data --raw_dir=/PATH/TO/img_raw/val/ --shards=128 --subset=validation
```
Reference: [https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/tree/master/examples/tensorflow/image_recognition/tensorflow_models/quantization/ptq#2-prepare-dataset](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/tree/master/examples/tensorflow/image_recognition/tensorflow_models/quantization/ptq#2-prepare-dataset)

### Pretrained FP32 Model preparation:

```
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/intel-optimized-tensorflow/models/v1_6/resnet50_fp32_pretrained_model.pb
```
### Run Qunatization:

Edit the file: [examples/tensorflow/image_recognition/tensorflow_models/quantization/ptq/resnet50_v1.yaml](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/examples/tensorflow/image_recognition/tensorflow_models/quantization/ptq/resnet50_v1.yaml), change all default dataset path (root: /path/to/evaluation/dataset) for quantization, evaluation to real local path to save the TFRecord format dataset generated previously during the data preparation stage.


```
cd examples/tensorflow/image_recognition/tensorflow_models/quantization/ptq
bash run_tuning.sh --config=resnet50_v1.yaml \
    --input_model=/PATH/TO/resnet50_fp32_pretrained_model.pb \
    --output_model=./nc_resnet50_v1.pb
```

Reference: [https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/tree/master/examples/tensorflow/image_recognition/tensorflow_models/quantization/ptq#1-resnet50-v10](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/tree/master/examples/tensorflow/image_recognition/tensorflow_models/quantization/ptq#1-resnet50-v10)

### Run Mix Precision (BFloat16 + FP32):

Refer to [Mixed Precision](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/docs/mixed_precision.md)

#### Convert Without Tuning Accuracy

This method is sample and convert more nodes to BFloat16 as possible. The accuracy of model would be lossed as unexpected.

```
python convert_bf16_without_tuning.py

from neural_compressor.experimental import MixedPrecision
converter = MixedPrecision()
converter.precisions = 'bf16'
converter.model = '/PATH/TO/resnet50_fp32_pretrained_model.pb'
optimized_model = converter()
optimized_model.save('nc_resnet50_v1_bf16.pb')
```
#### Convert With Tuning Accuracy

This method is accuracy driven and needs evaluation precedure. The accuracy of model would be lossed as expected, but less nodes are converted to BFloat16 compared with above method.

1. Edit resnet50_v1.yaml

Add

```
mixed_precision:
  precisions: 'bf16'
```

Like:
```
model:
  name: resnet50_v1
  framework: tensorflow

mixed_precision:
  precisions: 'bf16'

evaluation:
  accuracy:
    dataloader:
      ...
    metric:
      ...
```

2. Run Python
```
python convert_bf16_with_tuning.py

from neural_compressor.experimental import MixedPrecision
converter = MixedPrecision('resnet50_v1.yaml')
converter.precisions = 'bf16'
converter.model = '/PATH/TO/resnet50_fp32_pretrained_model.pb'
optimized_model = converter()
optimized_model.save('nc_resnet50_v1_bf16.pb')
```

### INT8 + BFloat16 + FP32

It's possible to mix INT8, BFloat16, FP32 in a model to optimize performance.

In this example, we could apply mixed precesion on the quantized model: nc_resnet50_v1.pb. So we could get INT8 + BFloat16 + FP32 model.


```
python convert_bf16_without_tuning.py

from neural_compressor.experimental import MixedPrecision
converter = MixedPrecision()
converter.precisions = 'bf16'
converter.model = '/PATH/TO/nc_resnet50_v1.pb'
optimized_model = converter()
optimized_model.save('nc_resnet50_v1_int8_bf16.pb')
```

In the log, we could see there is one operation: MatMul to be converted to BFloat16. That would improve the performance a little more.

If the quantized model has more operations are FP32, mixed precision could convert more to BFloat16 and gain better performance.

# Using Intel&reg; Distribution of OpenVINO&trade; Toolkit for Inference Acceleration

### Intel&reg; Distribution of OpenVINO&trade; Toolkit

OpenVINO™ is an open-source toolkit for optimizing and deploying AI inference with the following features:  
  
- Boost deep learning performance in computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing and other common tasks  
- Use models trained with popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more  
- Reduce resource demands and efficiently deploy on a range of Intel® platforms from edge to cloud  

![](images/ov_chart.png)  
  
The scheme below illustrates the typical workflow for deploying a deep learning model that has been trained using OpenVINO™:  

![](images/ov_flow.png)

- Train your model with popular frameworks like TensorFlow* and PyTorch*, or pick a pre-trained model from open model zoo.  
- Run Model Optimizer to perform static model analysis and produce an optimized Intermediate Representation (IR) of the model that can be inferred with OpenVINO™ Runtime. 
- Use OpenVINO Runtime API to read an Intermediate Representation (IR), ONNX, or PaddlePaddle model and execute it on preferred devices.  
- Tune and optimize the whole pipeline to improve final model performance by applying special optimization methods like quantization, pruning, preprocessing optimization, etc.  
- Once everything is done, [deploy your application with OpenVINO™](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_deployment_guide.html)  
  
For more information, refer to OpenVINO™ online documentation: <https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/index.html>

### Enable BFLOAT16/INT8 Inference with Intel® Deep Learning Boost

The default floating-point precision of a CPU primitive is f32. On platforms that natively support bfloat16 calculations with AVX512_BF16 or AMX_BF16 extensions, the bf16 type is automatically used instead of f32.  This will achieve better performance.  See the [BFLOAT16 – Hardware Numerics Definition white paper](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/bf16-hardware-numerics-definition-white-paper.pdf) for more details about the bfloat16 format.  

#########################################

REVIEWER NOTE : This guide uses both upper case and lower case BF16 and bf16 / F32 and f32. Make sure to be consistent across all the sections. 

##########################################

Using bf16 precision provides the following performance benefits:

- Faster multiplication of two bfloat16 numbers because of the shorter mantissa of the bfloat16 data.  
- Reduced memory consumption since bfloat16 data size is two times smaller than 32-bit float.  

To check whether a CPU device can support the bfloat16 data type, use the [openvino.runtime.Core.get_property](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/api/ie_python_api/_autosummary/openvino.runtime.Core.html#openvino.runtime.Core.get_property) to query the [ov::device::capabilities](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/groupov_runtime_cpp_prop_api.html#doxid-group-ov-runtime-cpp-prop-api-1gadb13d62787fc4485733329f044987294) property.  It should contain BF16 in the list of CPU capabilities as shown below:
  
    core = Core()
    cpu_optimization_capabilities = core.get_property("CPU", "OPTIMIZATION_CAPABILITIES")
   
Use the benchmark_app to check whether BF16/I8 is enabled when running inference:

- [Install OpenVINO™ Development Tools](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_install_guides_install_dev_tools.html) and [Install OpenVINO™ Runtime](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_install_guides_install_runtime.html)
- BFloat16
  - Download FP32 model from open model zoo (or pick your own FP32 model), download [horizontal-text-detection-0001](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/omz_models_model_horizontal_text_detection_0001.html) here as an example:  
`omz_downloader --name horizontal-text-detection-0001 --precisions FP32 -o .`  
  - Run benchmark app with -pc  
`benchmark_app -m ./intel/horizontal-text-detection-0001/FP32/horizontal-text-detection-0001.xml -pc`  
  - We can see some kernels are running with BF16 precison with both avx512 and amx instructions.

- INT8
  - Download INT8 model from open model zoo (or pick your own INT8 model), download [horizontal-text-detection-0001](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/omz_models_model_horizontal_text_detection_0001.html) here as an example:  
`omz_downloader --name horizontal-text-detection-0001 --precisions FP16-INT8 -o .`  
  - Run benchmark app with -pc  
`benchmark_app -m ./intel/horizontal-text-detection-0001/FP16-INT8/horizontal-text-detection-0001.xml -pc`  
  - We can see some kernels are running with I8 precison with both avx512 and amx instructions.

REVIEWER NOTE : This image contains benchmarking data. could it be possible to crop and only keep to the left of "realTime"?

##########################################


**Notes**  
  
Due to the reduced mantissa size of the bfloat16 data type, the resulting bf16 inference accuracy may differ from the f32 inference, especially for models that were not trained using the bfloat16 data type. If the bf16 inference accuracy is not acceptable, switch to the f32 precision.

C++:

	ov::Core core;
	core.set_property("CPU", ov::hint::inference_precision(ov::element::f32));

Python:

	core = Core()
	core.set_property("CPU", {"INFERENCE_PRECISION_HINT": "f32"})
	
If you use the benchmark_app, set -infer_precision to f32, for example:  

`benchmark_app -m ./intel/horizontal-text-detection-0001/FP32/horizontal-text-detection-0001.xml -pc -infer_precision f32`


REVIEWER NOTE : What is difference between how model changes here and what takes place using the neural compressor? Is it the same process?
