### Introduction to RocksDB

RocksDB started as an experimental Facebook project intended to develop a database product for high-workload services, which is comparable in data storage performance to a fast data storage system, flash memory in particular. RocksDB utilizes major source code from the open-source project, LevelDB*, as well as foundational concepts from the Apache* HBase project. The source code can be sourced back to LevelDB 1.5 fork.

RocksDB supports various configurations and can be tuned for different production environments (memory only, Flash, hard disks, or HDFS). It also supports a range of data compression algorithms and tools for debugging in production environments. RocksDB is mainly designed for excellent performance in fast storage applications and high workload services. Therefore, this database system requires sufficient utilization of the read and write speeds of flash memory and RAM. RocksDB needs to support efficient "point lookup" and "range scan" operations, and configuration of various parameters for random read and write operations in high-workload services or for performance tuning in case of heavy read and write traffic.

### IAA Setting

**accel-config** is a user-space tool for controlling and configuring IAA hardware devices.

**How to install accel-config tool**, please refer to *https://github.com/intel/idxd-config*

List all the active DSA devices discovered by the driver and the driver exported attributes.

```
accel-config list
```

Below is the script to enable 1 IAA device, configure IAA work queues and engines resources:

```shell
#Enable 1 IAA devices
for ((i=1;$i<=1;i=$i+2)) # modify this value to enable different number of IAA devices
do
    echo $i
    accel-config config-engine iax$i/engine$i.0 -g 0
    accel-config config-engine iax$i/engine$i.1 -g 0
    accel-config config-engine iax$i/engine$i.2 -g 0
    accel-config config-engine iax$i/engine$i.3 -g 0
    accel-config config-engine iax$i/engine$i.4 -g 0
    accel-config config-engine iax$i/engine$i.5 -g 0
    accel-config config-engine iax$i/engine$i.6 -g 0
    accel-config config-engine iax$i/engine$i.7 -g 0
    accel-config config-wq iax$i/wq$i.0 -g 0 -s 128 -p 10 -b 1 -d user -t 128 -m shared -y user -n iax_crypto

        "traffic_class_b":1
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Network Configuration

In the application scenario of RocksDB, since performance is usually limited by the bandwidth of the network rather than the performance of memory and persistent memory, running Redis across the network requires a large network card bandwidth (the larger, the better), which is recommended to be above 10GB/s.

## Software Tuning

Software configuration tuning is essential. From the Operating System to RocksDB configuration settings, they are all designed for general-purpose applications and default settings are almost never tuned for the best performance.

### Linux Kernel Optimization Settings

#### CPU Configuration

- Configure the CPU to the performance mode

```shell
cpupower -c <cpulist> frequency-set --governor performance
```

- Configure the energy/performance bias

```shell
x86_energy_perf_policy performance
```

- Configure the minimum value for the processor P-State

```shell
echo 100 > /sys/device/system/cpu/intel_pstate/min_perf_pct
```

#### Kernel Settings

- Configure the corresponding CPU core parameters

```sh
sysctl -w kernel.sched_domain.cpu<x>.domain0.max_newidle_lb_cost=0

sysctl -w kernel.sched_domain.cpu<x>.domain1.max_newidle_lb_cost=0
```

- Configure the scheduling granularity

```sh
sysctl -w kernel.sched_min_granularity_ns=10000000

sysctl -w kernel.sched_wakeup_granularity_ns=15000000
```

- Configure the virtual memory parameters

```sh
sysctl -w vm.dirty_ratio = 40

sysctl -w vm.swappiness = 10

sysctl -w vm.dirty_background_ratio=10
```

### RocksDB Architecture

RocksDB is a storage engine library of key-value store interfaces where keys and values are arbitrary byte streams and implemented based on the LSM-Tree algorithm.

RocksDB writes process: data is added to Write-Ahead Log (WAL) first for every insert or update, then it is inserted into Memtable for sorting. If the Memtable is already full, it will be converted to an immutable Memtable, and the data is refreshed as the SST file to level 0 in the back end. Similarly, when one level is full, "compaction" is triggered in the back end, which takes the data in the SST file and merges it with a higher-level SST file with an overlapping key range. The merged data takes the new SST file and writes it to a higher level, while the expired data is discarded. Since the higher level is 10 times larger than the lower level, compaction will cause serious write amplification and occupy a large amount of storage bandwidth. This is the main performance issue with LSM trees.

A Read operation starts with a Memtable search. Then a level-by-level search is performed in the SST files until the block data is found. If the block data is already in the block cache, the data is read directly from the cache (cache hit). Otherwise, the data is loaded onto the block cache from the SST file and read (cache miss). Block data is the smallest unit of I/O for a read operation and is usually larger than a key-value pair. Therefore, there will be a certain degree of reading amplification.

### Create a new RocksDB Compression with IAA/QPL

- **RocksDB Compression**

RocksDB supports many compressions LZ4, SNAPPY, ZSTD, and ZLIB. RocksDB uses them to compress a data block. 

- **Intel® QPL**

Intel® QPL is aimed to support capabilities of the new Intel® In-Memory Analytics Accelerator (Intel® IAA) available on Next Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors, codenamed Sapphire Rapids processor, such as very high throughput compression and decompression combined with primitive analytic functions, as well as to provide highly-optimized SW fallback on other Intel CPUs. 

- **A new compression of IAA/QPL**

Create a new RocksDB compressor with QPL API, which is used to enable IAA to compress/decompress. This new compressor has the same way to use as other compressions.

### Read&Write Optimization in RocksDB

![image-20221028155404036](./img/image-20221028155404036.png)

#### Write Optimization

In RocksDB, the Writing operation inserts data to the Memtable first, and then these data will be compressed according to the Block into an SST file.  The compressed performance significantly impacts writing efficiency. IAA has efficient compression/decompression, and it can speed up writing performance. It moves the compression load from the CPU to IAA and reduces CPU utilization.

#### Read Optimization

If the Reading operation doesn't search the Key from Block Cache, it needs to decompress the SST compressed Block. Decompression performance significantly impacts reading efficiency. According to the laboratory data, after enabling IAA decompression the reading performance has much improved compared with ZSTD (CPU) compression.

### Compaction Optimization in RocksDB

![image-20221028145919352](./img/image-20221028145919352.png)

Below is the Compaction flowchart, every compaction process contains compression and decompression which have a significant impact on compactions. After enable IAA compress, it can improve compaction performance and reduce CPU utilization.

## Conclusion

The combination of RocksDB, 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor, and Intel IAA is a very practical way to use RocksDB. The large dataset of compression needs a high compress ratio compress method, and IAA supplies this suitable compression way. It can get very good performance, while it can be conveniently used in customers' environment. IAA (De)compression has been created as a pluggable compressor, and it has no code change in customer's environment.

If customer use RocksDB + IAA in MySQL or Redis, it can get better performance compared with ZSTD (CPU) compression, and better storage saving compared with LZ4 (CPU) compression. In the performance experiment, after enabling IAA compression, the compression hotspot significantly drops the data accessing workload compared with other compressions. Meanwhile, RocksDB + IAA can save much MySQL buffer size while keeping the same throughput with ZSTD (CPU) compression.

IAA compression also has better throughput than ZSTD (CPU) compression, and it can supply better performance in data writing workloads.

As mentioned in the Facebook RocksDB introduction, RocksDB provides better data flashing and data compressing in reading, writing, and storing data workloads. IAA (De)compress function can improve these functions.
